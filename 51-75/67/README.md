Maximum path sum II
===================

<p>By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:courier new;font-size:12pt;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>3</b></span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>7</b></span> 4<br />
2 <span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>4</b></span> 6<br />
8 5 <span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>9</b></span> 3</p>
<p>That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.</p>

<p class="info"><b>NOTE:</b> This is a much more difficult version of <a href="index.php?section=problems&amp;id=18">Problem 18</a>. It is not possible to try every route to solve this problem, as there are 2<sup>99</sup> altogether! If you could check one trillion (10<sup>12</sup>) routes every second it would take over twenty billion years to check them all. There is an efficient algorithm to solve it. ;o)</p>
