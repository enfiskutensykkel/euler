Project Euler Solutions
=======================

These are my solutions to (some of) the problems that are found on 
[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/problems).

You will notice that my weapon of choice for a lot of these problems is
Python (2.7). This is because of the simplicity of the language, powerful standard
libraries (e.g. for [regular expressions](http://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html)
and [heavy number crunching](http://www.numpy.org/) and the flexibility in
dealing with weakly typed variables, large numbers, string processing etc.

Sadly I'm not all too familiar with [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/),
therefore some of my solutions that require speed are in C (GNU).
