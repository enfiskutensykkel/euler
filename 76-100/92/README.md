Square digit chains
===================


<p>A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits in a number to form a new number until it has been seen before.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<p style='margin-left:50px;'>44 &rarr; 32 &rarr; 13 &rarr; 10 &rarr; <b>1</b> &rarr; <b>1</b><br />
85 &rarr; <b>89</b> &rarr; 145 &rarr; 42 &rarr; 20 &rarr; 4 &rarr; 16 &rarr; 37 &rarr; 58 &rarr; <b>89</b></p>
<p>Therefore any chain that arrives at 1 or 89 will become stuck in an endless loop. What is most amazing is that EVERY starting number will eventually arrive at 1 or 89.</p>
<p>How many starting numbers below ten million will arrive at 89?</p>
